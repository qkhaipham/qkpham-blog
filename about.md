I’m Quang Khai Pham, a freelance software developer living in the Amsterdam area with over 10 years of experience building scalable, cloud-based solutions for enterprise businesses in different domains operating in the NL/EU market. 

I'm specialized in building backends with C# in .NET and using cloud platforms like Azure and AWS. Though I mostly focus on backend. I'm no stranger to HTMl, CSS, Javascript, IAC ( Terraform, Cloud formation, Bicep ) and scripting ( powershell / bash ), which allows me to build a solution from A - Z.
 
I’m passionate about modern development practices such as domain-driven design, microservices, and event-driven architecture. 

My other passions except for software engineering are travel, food and sports.

This blog is a space to share knowledge about .NET, give my opionion and view on development practices and  explore cutting-edge software development concepts. Whether you’re a developer, architect, or tech enthusiast, you’ll find valuable insights and practical tips to grow and build better systems. 

Let’s connect and innovate!
